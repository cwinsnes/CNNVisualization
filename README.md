# CNNVisualization
A Latex package for visualizing neural network models

Defines an environment `neuralnet` that contains several items that makes it easier to draw connected illustrations of items, for example for visualization of neural networks.

The file `randomwalk.pdf` shows you an example of what it can look
like. It was generated using the latex code in `randomwalk.tex`. Both
of the files can be found in the folder example, together with other
files required to generate the pdf.
